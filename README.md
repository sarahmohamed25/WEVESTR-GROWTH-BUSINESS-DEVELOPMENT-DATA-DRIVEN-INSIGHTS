This project was completed as part of a company-guided virtual internship during my Master’s in Big Data Analytics at Bay Atlantic University. It reflects a comprehensive data analytics solution crafted to analyze platform growth, user engagement, onboarding sources, and feature adoption for a startup-style business platform.

🚨 Note: All data and code shared are anonymized or simulated to maintain client confidentiality.

🔍 Project Overview
