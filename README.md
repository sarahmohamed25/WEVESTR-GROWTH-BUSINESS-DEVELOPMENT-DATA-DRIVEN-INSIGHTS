📊 WEVESTR GROWTH & BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT: DATA-DRIVEN INSIGHTS
This project was completed as part of a company-guided virtual internship during my Master’s in Big Data Analytics at Bay Atlantic University. It reflects a comprehensive data analytics solution crafted to analyze platform growth, user engagement, onboarding sources, and feature adoption for a startup-style business platform.

🔍 Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to identify user behavior trends, detect adoption gaps, evaluate retention performance, and drive business recommendations through end-to-end data analytics. The entire project was completed using Python, with final outputs designed for Grafana dashboards and professional reporting.

🧱 Project Structure
📂 Data Compilation & Exploration
Combined and explored multi-sheet Excel datasets.  
Scripts: `compile_data.py`, `explore_data.py`
🧼 Data Cleaning & Preparation
Cleaned missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized datasets.  
Scripts: `missing_values_analysis.py`, `handle_missing_values.py`, `remove_duplicates.py`, `save_cleaned_data_csv.py`, `compile_cleaned_data.py`
📈 Growth, Onboarding & Feature Adoption Analysis
Measured growth trends, source attribution, user logins, and feature usage.  
Scripts: `Companies_Joined_2022_2023_2024.py`, `Source_Breakdown_Microsoft_vs_Website.py`, `feature_adoption_analysis.py`
🔁 Engagement, Activity & Retention Analysis
Explored stakeholder/document engagement, industry insights, and login-based retention.  
Script: `engagement_activity_retention_analysis.py`
⚠️ Anomaly & Discrepancy Resolution
Conducted root cause analysis for conflicting retention metrics.  
Script: `merged_retention_analysis.py`

✅ Key Achievements & Insights
- 🧩 **Resolved conflicting retention metrics** by conducting a detailed anomaly analysis across separate data sheets, ultimately identifying data structure gaps and missing records as root causes.
- 📉 **Identified high churn risk**, with 98% of companies showing no login activity in the past 3 months—highlighting the need for improved user engagement.
- 📈 **Mapped adoption gaps** across core features (ESOP, KPI, Financials, Integrations), revealing that while onboarding was high, platform feature usage was relatively low.
- 🏗️ **Provided business recommendations** including the introduction of a dedicated data manager and centralized database consolidation strategy to ensure analysis consistency and data hygiene.

💡 Business Recommendations
- Assign a dedicated database manager** to routinely update and validate user engagement metrics.
- Consolidate all login and usage metrics into a single master sheet** to avoid analytical discrepancies and maintain data integrity.
- Automate data syncing pipelines** using tools like Python scripts or ETL platforms (e.g., Airflow) to ensure consistent data ingestion.
- Develop internal dashboards using Grafana or Tableau** for real-time engagement and retention monitoring.
- Regularly audit data quality** before analytics phases to prevent misleading or conflicting insights.
